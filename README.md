# Project created with 0D (drawware)

Diagrams corresponding to my understanding of the Dungeon Crawler game presented in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFeJZRdhKcI&list=PLcGKfGEEONaCIl5eU53uPBnRJ9rbIH32R&index=72&t=13s

The file *generated.odin* was automatically compiled from the diagrams using the gen0D app (in a different repo). A few minor manual edits were required. It is expected that all of the code can be generated without applying manual edits, but a few fixes to the gen0D app are still required. Nothing onerous, mostly formatting stuff like the package name, some quoted double-quotes that shouldn't be quoted, etc.

gen0D can be found in https://github.com/guitarvydas/gen0d.
